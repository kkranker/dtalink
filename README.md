# dtalink: Stata package to implement probabilistic record linkage

by Keith Kranker

# SQL and SAS example

I was asked how to perform probabilistic record linkage using SQL or SAS.
One option is to use a SQL cross join, like in this toy example.
However, I've not tested this with a large dataset, but I suspect it
could be  than the DTALINK Stata code.
